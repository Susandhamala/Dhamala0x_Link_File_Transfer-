**Overview**
Dhamala0x\_Link\_File\_Transfer is a secure, peer-to-peer encrypted file transfer utility developed by Susan Dhamala (alias: 0x4m4). This tool was born out of the necessity for private, encrypted communication over local networks and is designed with simplicity, security, and cross-platform support in mind.

It‚Äôs more than just a programming assignment‚Äîit's a real-world solution for secure file transmission in ethical hacking, cybersecurity training, and personal privacy scenarios.

**üîí Key Features**

* **AES-256 Encryption:** Uses military-grade encryption to protect file content.
* **PBKDF2 Key Derivation:** Strengthens passwords using salt and 100,000 iterations.
* **Graphical Interface (GUI):** Built with Tkinter using a clean and futuristic dark theme.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and even Android via compatible Python environments.
* **No External Servers:** All encryption and file processing is local; no data is stored or transmitted externally.

**üßë‚Äçüíª Why Use This Tool?**
Unlike many cloud-based file transfer tools, Dhamala0x\_Link\_File\_Transfer ensures full **end-to-end confidentiality**. File encryption happens on the sender's device and decryption on the receiver's side using a shared password. Ideal for:

* Ethical Hackers
* Cybersecurity Professionals
* Students and Privacy Advocates

**üíª Requirements**

* **Python 3.x**
* **Libraries:**

  * tkinter
  * socket (standard)
  * cryptography
